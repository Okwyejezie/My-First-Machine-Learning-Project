# My-First-Machine-Learning-Project
The main objective of this mini project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Create a model by which Big Mart can analyse and predict the outlet production sales. A perfect project to learn Data Analytics and apply Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random and Forest Regressor) to predict the outlet production sales.
